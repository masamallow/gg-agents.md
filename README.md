# GG AGENTS.md

Personal **G**eneral **G**lobal **AGENTS.md** ― A universal agent instruction file for AI coding agents.

## Overview

This repository provides [AGENTS.gg.md](AGENTS.gg.md), my personal agent instruction file that offers consistent guidelines and preferences for AI coding agents (like Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) across all my projects and tools.

By maintaining a single, centralized instruction file, I ensure that AI assistants understand my development workflow, coding standards, and safety practices regardless of which project I'm working on.

## Features

🚧 _Documentation in progress_

## What's Included

📝 _Coming soon_

## Usage

### Quick Setup

1. Clone this repository, then `cd /path/to/gg-agents.md`

2. Run the setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The script will:
- Create symlinks from each AI agent's global instruction file to `AGENTS.gg.md`
- Backup any existing instruction files to `bak/<service>/` before overwriting

### Supported Services

| Service | Global Instruction Path | Symlink Target |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------|
| [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md) | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`    | `AGENTS.gg.md` |
| [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/blog/using-claude-md-files) | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`   | `AGENTS.gg.md` |

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup, create symlinks yourself:

```bash
# Codex
ln -sf /path/to/gg-agents.md/AGENTS.gg.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md

# Claude Code
ln -sf /path/to/gg-agents.md/AGENTS.gg.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

## Customization

Feel free to fork this repository and customize the `AGENTS.gg.md` file to match your own preferences.
