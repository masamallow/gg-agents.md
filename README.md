# GG AGENTS.md

Personal **G**eneral **G**lobal **AGENTS.md** ― A universal configuration profile for AI coding agents.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal AGENTS.md configuration file ([AGENTS.gg.md](AGENTS.gg.md) in this project) that provides consistent guidelines and preferences for AI coding agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) across all my projects and tools.

By maintaining a single, centralized AGENTS.gg.md file, I ensure that AI assistants understand my development workflow, coding standards, and safety practices regardless of which project I'm working on.
